--------------- BUILDING AI COURSE ASSIGNMENT --------------

Your idea in a nutshell: Name your project and prepare to describe it briefly.

---- JOB APPLICATION ATTACHMENT GRADE CALCULATOR --------

Idea is that PDF documents recognize directly values and characters, turning into fex. Excel spreadsheet and calculate values
Could be referenced as a scanner for school documents
At first notice the columns like (number of courses) and then rows (grade)
Also rows with letter to be noticed like (PASS/FAIL) and so forth.
Background:

What is the problem your idea will solve? -The idea would be that students, job employers or any other job applications who need to quickly notify their documents into values, could use the app without calculating manually. -Same type of issue as LinkedIn 'quick apply' type of button

How common or frequent is this problem? -Everyday problem as people seek jobs in consultant companies that require accurate values of transcript of records, diplomas, degrees et cetera.

What is your personal motivation? -My personal motivation would be to get rid of unnecessary paper of old school work, certificate of employments and so on.

Why is this topic important or interesting? -This topic would be easier for anyone working on human resources to automate childish a like tasks into digitized version.

Data and AI techniques:

What data sources does your project depend on? -Almost all AI solutions depend on some data. The availability and quality of the data are essential.

Data would be pdf documents.

Which AI techniques do you think will be helpful?

-Techniques that are used in my Master's Degree Thesis Work.

Depending on whether you've been doing the programming exercises or not, you may choose to include a concrete demo implemented by coding, using some actual data! How is it used: What is the context in which your solution is used, and by whom?

-Preferrably write few line of code as you read in PDF documents with Python -The next one is to automate or just notice some University fonts or characters so could create a demo link for university.

Who are the people affected by it? It’s important to appreciate the viewpoints of all those affected. -The student's or attendees graduating.

Challenges: What does your project not solve? It’s important to understand that any technological solution will have its limitations. -The project does not solve misconceptions with different studies.

-FEX: If two students apply for the same job, an HR assistant need to assign which one has more valid course completed for the job position.

What next: How could your project grow and become something even more? -This project could wider even more than LinkedIn or other careers page on websites.. People could be hired easier.

Acknowledgments: If you’re using open source code or documents in your project, make sure you give credit to the creators. Mention your sources of inspiration, too. -Thanks, sure do
